                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Culture shock is experienced by me like a majority of people, essentially changing their environment. 
                    I am originally from Iran. I have been in Canada since September 2012. When I came to Canada, I had a 
                    lot of challenges. In this phase, I figured the difference between my old culture and a new culture 
                    was enormous.The first stage is the best experience: meeting new people, learning about different habits, 
                    and social media. I felt excited, euphoric, and optimistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last phase is knows as the "adaption" Phase.Now I have 
                    adapted. I have figured out the best way to avoid or reduce culture shock
                    is to be enthusiastic, and to yean for positive interations with the host and the culture of people there.
